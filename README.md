Objective:
            The project aimed to perform sentiment analysis on social media data (e.g., Twitter) to understand public opinion about topics, products, or events. This was achieved using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify sentiments as either positive or negative and evaluate the model’s performance.

Key Activities:
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset, converting text data into numerical format using TF-IDF.
Handled stop words and optimized feature selection.
Model Building:

Split data into training and testing sets (80%-20%).
Built a Logistic Regression model for binary sentiment classification.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Visualized the results through confusion matrix and bar plots.
Visualizations:

Created plots for sentiment distribution, model performance, and confusion matrix analysis to provide a clearer understanding of strengths and weaknesses.

Technology Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Key Algorithm: Logistic Regression for binary classification

Outcomes:
Model Performance:

Achieved an accuracy of X%, with detailed performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for both sentiment classes.
Sentiment Insights:

Visualized sentiment distribution, showing the balance between positive and negative tweets.
Confusion matrix highlighted areas of model misclassification.
Actionable Insights:

Insights can help businesses understand public sentiment and make informed decisions.
The approach can be extended for deeper sentiment analysis and time-series trends.
